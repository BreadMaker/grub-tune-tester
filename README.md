# Grub Tune Tester


**GTT** is an online tool to test your `GRUB_INIT_TUNE` beforehand.

## How to use

Just enter a `GRUB_INIT_TUNE` using the following format:

`tempo freq duration [freq duration freq duration...]`

Where `tempo` is the base for all note durations in beats per minute (60 gives
a 1-second base, 120 gives a half-second base, etc.), `freq` is the frequency
(in hertz) of the sound (set 0 to produce a rest), and `duration` is the
duration of the sound in a 4/4 bar (meaning 1 is a quarter of a bar and 4 a full
bar).

## How to help

This project is in a very early stage, so there's a lot of room for improvements.
